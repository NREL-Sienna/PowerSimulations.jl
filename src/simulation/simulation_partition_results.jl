# Failure-handling contract for partitioned simulations (run_parallel_simulation and
# join_simulation):
#
# 1. If any partition job fails, status.json of the joined simulation records
#    RunStatus.FAILED.
# 2. The exception that caused a failure always reaches the caller. Status recording and
#    cleanup inside catch blocks are best-effort: guarded by one try/catch that logs and
#    continues, and never allowed to replace the original exception.
# 3. A missing partition status.json means that the partition job failed. Any other error
#    while reading partition results (permissions, parse errors, wrong paths) indicates a
#    problem with this process or environment and propagates instead of being reclassified
#    as a partition failure. The one exception: with skip_failures = true, a partition
#    store file that cannot be opened is skipped, because recovering from corrupted
#    partition outputs is the purpose of that flag.
# 4. InterruptException is a user action, not a failure: it propagates without recording
#    RunStatus.FAILED.
# 5. The datasets of a partition store must exactly match the merged store; a mismatch in
#    either direction is an error.
# 6. Failure paths are guarded exactly one level deep. If a guarded best-effort step
#    itself fails, that is logged and otherwise out of scope.
