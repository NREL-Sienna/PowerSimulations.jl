# # Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR)
#
# ## Introduction
#
# Static branch ratings use a fixed thermal limit ``R^\text{max}`` for each transmission
# line. **Dynamic Line Ratings (DLR)** replace this fixed limit with a time-varying
# parameter ``R^\text{max}_t``, allowing the optimizer to exploit periods when ambient
# conditions (wind, temperature) permit higher line flows. This reduces curtailment and
# can lower total generation cost compared to conservative static limits.
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to:
#
# 1. Attach a DLR time series to transmission branches in a `PowerSystems.System`.
# 2. Build a `PTDFPowerModel` template that activates the DLR constraints.
# 3. Run a multi-step simulation and read the resulting line flows and DLR parameters.
#
# !!! note
#
#     Dynamic Line Ratings are supported for the `StaticBranch` (or
#     `SecurityConstrainedStaticBranch`) formulation combined with a
#     `PTDFPowerModel` (or any `AbstractPTDFModel`), a DC power flow
#     (`DCPPowerModel` / any `PM.AbstractActivePowerModel`), or full AC
#     (`ACPPowerModel` / any `PM.AbstractPowerModel`) network model.
#     With `StaticBranchUnbounded` the formulation does not enforce flow
#     limits, so a time-varying rating would have no effect: template
#     validation emits a warning and the branch rating time series is ignored
#     (the model still builds).

#     [PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl)
#     is a helper library that makes it easier to reproduce examples in the documentation
#     and tutorials. Normally you would pass your local files to create the system data
#     instead of calling `build_system`. For more details visit
#     [PowerSystemCaseBuilder Documentation](https://nrel-sienna.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/how_to/powersystembuilder/)

# ## Preparing DLR Time Series
#
# DLR is represented in `PowerSystems.jl` as a `SingleTimeSeries` (or `Deterministic`)
# attached directly to each branch component. The time series values are scaling factors
# applied to the branch's static `get_rating`. A value of `1.15` means the line can carry
# 15% more than its rated static capacity during that hour; a value of `0.95` represents a
# de-rating.
#
# The helper function below iterates over a list of branch names, constructs a
# `SingleTimeSeries` from a vector of hourly scaling factors, and attaches it to each
# branch with `scaling_factor_multiplier = get_rating` so PowerSimulations knows how to
# convert the factor to a per-unit limit.

# ## Define the Problem Template
#
# The template must use `PTDFPowerModel` to enable DLR constraints. The key step is
# constructing `DeviceModel` with `time_series_names` that maps
# `BranchRatingTimeSeriesParameter` to the time series name `"dynamic_line_ratings"`
# attached to the branches above.
#
# !!! tip
#
#     Any branch type that has the `"dynamic_line_ratings"` time series attached and is
#     configured with `BranchRatingTimeSeriesParameter` in `time_series_names` will
#     have time-varying flow limits. Branches without the time series attached will fall
#     back to static limits automatically.

# !!! tip
#
#     To verify that DLR constraints are binding, compare the line flows in `line_flows`
#     against the corresponding DLR parameter values in `dlr_params`. When demand is high
#     and the DLR limit is tight, the flow should be at or near the DLR limit rather than
#     the static rating.
