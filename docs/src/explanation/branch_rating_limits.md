# [Branch Rating Limits](@id branch_rating_limits)

This page explains how PowerSimulations derives a flow **rating** for an AC
transmission element and how that rating is turned into optimization
constraints. It covers every reduction type produced by
`PowerNetworkMatrices` (PNM), the formulations that consume the rating, the
difference between linear and nonlinear network models, the parallel-branch
aggregation attribute, and the branch-rating time series.

For the per-formulation constraint algebra (variable names, slacks, objective
terms) see the [`PowerSystems.Branch` Formulations](@ref) page in the
Formulation Library. This page is the conceptual companion: *where the
constraint branch flow limit on the right-hand side comes from*.

## The single source of truth

All branch flow ratings flow through one type-aware entry point.
`branch_rating(entry, device_model)` returns the scalar rating for a reduction
`entry`, and `min_max_flow_limits(entry, device_model)` wraps it into the
symmetric pair `(min = -rating, max = rating)` used by linear constraints. Every
constraint builder — linear or nonlinear, static or time series — resolves its
rating through this path so the same physical element gets the same limit
regardless of the network model.

`branch_rating` is *type-aware*: it dispatches on the kind of reduction entry
PNM produced for the element and delegates the aggregation policy to PNM. It
does **not** reimplement per-type rating math; extend
`PowerNetworkMatrices.get_equivalent_rating` instead if a new element type needs
support.

## PNM rating aggregation by reduction type

Network reduction can collapse several physical branches into one equivalent
element. The rating of that equivalent element depends on its topology:

| Reduction entry                                                          | Rating policy                                                                                                                                                      |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Single line / two-winding transformer (`PSY.ACTransmission`)             | `PSY.get_rating`                                                                                                                                                   |
| `PSY.GenericArcImpedance`                                                | `PSY.get_max_flow` (used as a rating proxy)                                                                                                                        |
| Three-winding transformer winding (`PNM.ThreeWindingTransformerWinding`) | The winding-specific rating (primary/secondary/tertiary); falls back to the parent transformer rating when the winding rating is `0.0`                             |
| Series chain (`PNM.BranchesSeries`)                                      | **Weakest link**: the minimum equivalent rating across the chain members. A parallel block embedded in the chain contributes its single-element-contingency rating |
| Parallel group (`PNM.BranchesParallel`)                                  | Attribute-driven — see [Parallel-branch aggregation](@ref parallel_branch_aggregation)                                                                             |
| Mixed parallel group (`PNM.MixedBranchesParallel`)                       | Always the plain sum of member ratings (`sum_of_max`); the attribute is ignored                                                                                    |

A **post-contingency** (emergency) rating uses the parallel structure with
`PSY.rating_b` in place of `PSY.rating`:
`PowerNetworkMatrices.get_equivalent_emergency_rating` mirrors the normal
aggregation type-for-type, and for a single `ACTransmission` it returns
`PSY.get_rating_b` and falls back to `PSY.get_rating` when no `rating_b` is
defined. Three-winding windings have no `rating_b` in PowerSystems and fall
back to their normal winding rating.

## [Parallel-branch aggregation](@id parallel_branch_aggregation)

When PNM produces a homogeneous `PNM.BranchesParallel` group, the way the
individual circuit ratings combine into one limit is a modeling choice carried
on the `DeviceModel` as an attribute:

  - **Attribute key:** `"parallel_branch_max_rating_method"` (the constant
    `PARALLEL_BRANCH_MAX_RATING_KEY`).
  - **No default:** there is no defensible default policy, so the attribute must
    be set explicitly on the `DeviceModel`. Building a model in which the
    reduction produces a homogeneous parallel group without it errors.

Valid values:

| Value                          | Aggregated rating                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                           |
|:------------------------------ |:-------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"single_element_contingency"` | ``\sum_i S_i - \max_i S_i``                  | N-1 surviving capacity after the largest-rated circuit trips. A single-circuit group has zero capacity under this policy                          |
| `"sum_of_max"`                 | ``\sum_i S_i``                               | Each circuit independently loadable to its own thermal limit (least conservative)                                                                 |
| `"impedance_averaged"`         | ``\sum_i f_i S_i,\; f_i = b_i / \sum_k b_k`` | Susceptance-weighted average, reflecting how DC flow physically splits across the group. Errors if total series susceptance is zero or non-finite |

Set it like any other `DeviceModel` attribute:

```julia
set_device_model!(
    template,
    DeviceModel(
        Line,
        StaticBranch;
        attributes = Dict("parallel_branch_max_rating_method" => "sum_of_max"),
    ),
)
```

`PNM.MixedBranchesParallel` (a parallel group whose members carry different
`DeviceModel` preferences) always uses `sum_of_max`, because there is no
defensible way to pick one member's attribute for the whole group.

Security-constrained branch formulations carry one additional default
attribute, `"include_planned_outages" => false`, and require the same explicit
`"parallel_branch_max_rating_method"`.

## How the rating enters the optimization

### Linear network models

This covers the PTDF family (`PTDFPowerModel`, `AreaPTDFPowerModel`, and other
`AbstractPTDFModel`s) and the DC power model (`DCPPowerModel` and other
`PM.AbstractActivePowerModel`s). `CopperPlatePowerModel` and
`AreaBalancePowerModel` enforce no per-branch flow limits.

The active-power flow is bounded symmetrically by the aggregated rating:

```math
-R \;\le\; f_{b,t} \;\le\; R
```

applied through `FlowRateConstraint` (PTDF and DC) or, for
`StaticBranchBounds`, directly as variable bounds on the flow variable.
A **standalone** `MonitoredLine` is the exception — it carries explicit,
possibly asymmetric `flow_limits`. Note this exception only applies when the
`MonitoredLine` is *not* collapsed by network reduction: a `MonitoredLine` that
is a member of a reduction group resolves through the symmetric aggregated
`branch_rating` like any other reduced element and its `flow_limits` are not
carried into the equivalent (see [MonitoredLine](@ref monitored_line_rating)).
`PhaseShiftingTransformer` under `PhaseAngleControl` additionally bounds the
phase-shifter angle to ``[-\pi/2,\, \pi/2]``.

### Nonlinear network models

For full AC models (any `PM.AbstractPowerModel` that is not an active-power-only
model) the apparent-power limit is enforced per flow direction:

```math
(P^{ft}_{b,t})^2 + (Q^{ft}_{b,t})^2 \;\le\; R^2
\qquad
(P^{tf}_{b,t})^2 + (Q^{tf}_{b,t})^2 \;\le\; R^2
```

through `FlowRateConstraintFromTo` and `FlowRateConstraintToFrom`. The rating
``R`` is the **same** type-aware `branch_rating` value used by the linear path;
only its application differs (squared, on apparent power).

## Branch rating time series

A branch may carry a time series that makes its rating vary per time step (for
example dynamic line ratings). The time series is **normalized**: its values
are a per-unit multiplier of a static rating, and the static rating is supplied
as the parameter *multiplier*. The right-hand side that the solver sees is
therefore:

  - Linear models: `parameter[t] * multiplier`, equal to the time-varying
    rating `rating(t)`.
  - Nonlinear models: `parameter[t] * multiplier`, equal to `rating(t)^2`.

PSI parameter objects are **never squared** in a constraint expression (a
squared parameter is not a valid parametric term). So for the apparent-power
limit the right-hand side stays linear in the parameter — `parameter * multiplier` — and the parameter and multiplier are instead configured so their
product is `rating(t)^2` directly. The simulation update policy refreshes only
the parameter value each window; the multiplier is fixed at build time.

The multiplier is resolved with the **same type-aware aggregation as the static
path**, so series chains, three-winding windings and single elements all scale
the correct equivalent rating. There is one deliberate exception:

  - **Parallel groups:** a rating time series attached to one member of a
    parallel group cannot be distributed across the group's other circuits.
    The multiplier is the group's combined rating (`sum_of_max`) **regardless
    of `"parallel_branch_max_rating_method"`**, and a warning is emitted.
  - **Post-contingency** (`PostContingencyBranchRatingTimeSeriesParameter`):
    the multiplier uses the emergency (`rating_b`) aggregation — the summed
    emergency rating for parallel groups, and the type-aware emergency rating
    otherwise.

Support and validation:

  - Branch rating time series are only supported with `StaticBranch` and
    `AbstractSecurityConstrainedStaticBranch`. Any other formulation —
    including `StaticBranchUnbounded`, which enforces no flow limits — raises a
    `ConflictingInputsError` rather than silently ignoring the time series.
  - At build a sanity check warns if the normalized series scaled by the
    multiplier ever falls below the device's static rating (i.e. the series is
    expected to represent at-or-above-nominal capacity).

## [MonitoredLine](@id monitored_line_rating)

A **standalone** `PSY.MonitoredLine` (one that is *not* collapsed into a
reduction group — see below) does not use the symmetric `branch_rating` path
because it carries explicit `flow_limits` that can be tighter than, and
asymmetric to, its rating. The asymmetry is **not discarded** — it is enforced
by the directional constraints; only the single symmetric general rate limit
cannot represent it and falls back to the tighter of the two:

  - General rate limit (`FlowRateConstraint`): a single symmetric bound
    ``\min(\text{rating},\ \text{flow\_limits.from\_to},\ \text{flow\_limits.to\_from})``.
    Because one symmetric constraint structurally cannot encode an asymmetric
    limit, the minimum of the two directions is used and a warning is emitted
    when `from_to` and `to_from` differ — flagging that this particular
    constraint is conservative, not that the asymmetry is lost.
  - Directional limits (`FlowLimitFromToConstraint` / `FlowLimitToFromConstraint`):
    these **preserve the asymmetry**, using `flow_limits.from_to` and
    `flow_limits.to_from` respectively. This is where the asymmetric input is
    actually honored.

### `MonitoredLine` inside a reduction

When a `MonitoredLine` is collapsed by network reduction into an equivalent
element (`PNM.BranchesParallel`, `PNM.BranchesSeries`,
`PNM.MixedBranchesParallel`, …), the reduction `entry` is a PNM reduction type,
**not** a `PSY.MonitoredLine`, so dispatch goes through the type-aware
`branch_rating` → `PowerNetworkMatrices.get_equivalent_rating` path. That
aggregation consumes only the scalar `PSY.get_rating` (or `PSY.get_rating_b`
for the post-contingency rating); the explicit, possibly asymmetric
`flow_limits` are **not propagated into the reduced equivalent element**. A
reduced arc that contains a `MonitoredLine` is therefore bounded by the
symmetric aggregated rating like any other reduced element. The directional
`FlowLimitFromToConstraint` / `FlowLimitToFromConstraint` are only added when
the `MonitoredLine` is modeled as a standalone (un-reduced) element. If the
asymmetric directional limits must be enforced, pin the `MonitoredLine`'s
endpoints so reduction does not collapse it (e.g. via `irreducible_buses`).
