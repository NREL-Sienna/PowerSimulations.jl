# Temporary Section for Unsorted Documentation Content

This file collects content from the old documentation that is not currently included in the restructured Di√°taxis layout. It is meant for tracking purposes only and will not be included in the final updated documentation.

## From: Welcome Page

### How the documentation is structured

`PowerSimulations.jl` documentation and code are organized according to the needs of different users depending on their skillset and requirements. In broad terms there are three categories:

  - **Modeler**: Users that want to solve an operations problem or run a simulation using the existing models in `PowerSimulations.jl`. For instance, answer questions about the change in operation costs in future fuel mixes. Check the formulations library page to choose a modeling strategy that fits your needs.

  - **Model Developer**: Users that want to develop custom models and workflows for the simulation of a power system operation. For instance, study the impacts of an stochastic optimization problem over a deterministic.
  - **Code Base Developers**: Users that want to add new core functionalities or fix bugs in the core capabilities of `PowerSimulations.jl`.

`PowerSimulations.jl` is an active project under development, and we welcome your feedback,
suggestions, and bug reports.

**Note**: `PowerSimulations.jl` uses the data model implemented in [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystems.jl)
to construct optimization models. In most cases, you need to add `PowerSystems.jl` to your scripts.

### Installation

An appropriate optimization solver is required for running PowerSimulations models. Refer to [`JuMP.jl` solver's page](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Install-a-solver) to select the most appropriate for the application of interest.
